# Spring Boot CRUD Application

This is a basic Spring Boot application that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a `Product` entity. The project uses Spring Data JPA to interact with a MySQL database (or H2 for in-memory testing).

## Features
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on products.
- RESTful API for managing products.
- MySQL or H2 database support.
- Service layer for business logic.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 11+**
- **Maven 3.6+**
- **MySQL** (if using MySQL instead of H2)

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/springboot-crud-app.git
   cd springboot-crud-app
